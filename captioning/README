This folder mainly includes the preprocessing code for the web image-caption data. The preprocessingincludes these steps: removing abstract images using image keywords, removing corrupted images, removing images with noisy captions (with location tags) and purify captions, split data into train and validation set.
The Python functions should also be processed in this order.
(1) split_keywords.py: preprocess the keywords by splitting words into a list for each image.
(2) filter_abstract_images.py: removing abstract images using keywords extracted from image names.
(3) remove_invalid_images.py: remove corrupted images
(4) caption_filter_batch.py: removing images with noisy captions, also purify captions and keep only one sentence in one caption.
(5) train_val_split.py: split data into train and validation set.
